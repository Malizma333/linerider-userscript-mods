# Console Scripts

These scripts can be pasted in the console to do cool things. Here is a little more info about them.

## Platformer Controller

Turns on relative gravity, and allows you to control the rider with the A and D keys to move left and right, relative to the sled's orientation.

## WASD Controller

Disables gravity, then allows you to controll bosh with WASD keys, like a top down controller.

## Line Optimizer

Downloads an optimized version of your track file. Only works if camera dimensions are specified.
- Lines outside the borders of the camera boundaries up to the timeline length are removed
- Lines on locked layers are kept
- Duplicate lines are removed
